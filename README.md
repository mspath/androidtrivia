# Android Trivia

A simple app that asks the user trivia questions about Android development.

This is the toy app for lesson 3 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin] course on Udacity.

It makes use of the Navigation component within Jetpack to move the user between different screens.
Each screen is implemented as a Fragment.
The app navigates using buttons, the Action Bar, and the Navigation Drawer.

Note: this also works nicely in multiwindow-mode on a chromebook.
